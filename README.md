# Household Item Depreciation 

### Mission Statement
* I have had a serious problem with wanting too many things. Motorcycles, laptops, mobiles etc .....
* In an effort to be a bit more financially savy I decided to track the depreciation of household items I buy. That way I can get a better understanding of how much I'm spending on trivial things. 
* What better way to do it than to build my own system for it.
